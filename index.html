                ' Amery International R&D Log #900 Project: Matter deconstruction, storage and reassembly.  This is [REDACTED], lead research for the Research and Development division of Amery International. Writing a progress report on the prototype device of the assigned project. Our division has been able to make a lot of progress on optimizing and fixing a lot of the issues so far, but we have a long way to go. For starters: The machine is now capable of recreating [REDACTED] nearly perfectly (ocassional missing bits or ocassionally outputting wrong materials), wasting less power and going much faster. However, [REDACTED] will still drastically slow it down if scanned. Currently it is next to impossible to store [REDACTED] data and get it back, but were working on fixing that and improving the design of the machine alongside that. It is very adviced to stay AWAY from the machine while its operating, we had a guy hospitalized because of an explosive material being wrongly outputted. Weve also made a lot of interesting discoveries during this project that may be very interesting to the administration, I am expecting increased funding for "that" though. Anyway, all [REDACTED] tests are either done on [REDACTED], or small [REDACTED] and I can assure you that we have NOT tried putting anyone in those yet. (The results are already horrific enough with the [REDACTED]) That is all for the progress report. Expect a new progress report in a month or more, weve been going pretty slow recently.
